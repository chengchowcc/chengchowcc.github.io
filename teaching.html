  <p>
    My teaching philosophy begins with the belief that social work education is a transformative space where students learn to examine systems, engage communities ethically, and develop the confidence to become changemakers. As an immigrant, a first-generation college student, and a member of the LGBTQ community whose academic journey spans globally, I bring a transnational and interdisciplinary perspective to the classroom.

  <h4 style="margin-top: 24px;">Creating inclusive and caring learning environments</h4>
  <p>
    I approach teaching as a relational practice rooted in cultural humility, accessibility, and compassion. I begin each course by building shared expectations and community agreements, and I discuss my own positionality to encourage reflexive practice. Drawing on trauma-informed and anti-oppressive principles, I offer multiple avenues for participation, including anonymous feedback, reflective writing, class discussions, and small-group work, allowing students to engage in ways that align with their strengths. My teaching is supported by formal pedagogical training in inclusive course design, assessment, and student-centered learning, and I regularly integrate mid-semester feedback to improve clarity, pacing, and accessibility.
  </p>

  <h4 style="margin-top: 24px;">Teaching students to think critically about systems, power, and evidence</h4>
  <p>
    A central goal of my teaching is to help students analyze how policies, institutions, and forms of knowledge shape lived realities. In social policy courses, I introduce frameworks that help students understand the structural forces behind social problems and policy decisions. In research methods courses, I guide students to interrogate data critically, examining how measurement decisions, sampling practices, and analytic choices can reproduce inequities. These conversations encourage students to consider whose experiences are represented and whose are missing, and to approach evidence with ethical responsibility and a social justice lens.
  </p>

  <h4 style="margin-top: 24px;">Active, experiential, and community-engaged learning</h4>
  <p>
    Students learn most deeply when they can apply classroom concepts to real-world contexts. I integrate policy simulations, community narratives, case-based instruction, and participatory activities that bridge theory and practice. Drawing from my community-engaged research on migration, health, and policy, I help students understand how research and policy operate within lived contexts. I also incorporate critical digital literacy, encouraging students to analyze algorithmic systems and digital health tools while considering their ethical and structural implications. These approaches position students as knowledge producers and emerging practitioners who can contribute meaningfully to social change.
